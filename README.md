# BubbleClick
Experimental animation of creating bubbles in p5 js

They pop out wherever you click....

Yeah, i dunno what was going through my head while coding for this...

Used p5 js framework to code and hopefully brushed up my OOP skills in javascript.

Here's the link to the demo :

(click anywhere on the canvas to see the bubbles pop out)
